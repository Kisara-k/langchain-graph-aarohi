## DeepSeek R1 vs Traditional Models

### Traditional Model Response Pattern:

```
User: "What is 25 * 4?"
Model: "25 * 4 equals 100"
```

### DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Pattern:

```
User: "What is 25 * 4?"
Model: "Let me think step by step:
1. I need to multiply 25 by 4
2. 25 × 4 = 25 × (2 × 2) = (25 × 2) × 2
3. 25 × 2 = 50
4. 50 × 2 = 100
Therefore, 25 * 4 = 100"
```

## Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Model Not Found**

   ```bash
   # Ensure DeepSeek R1 is properly pulled
   ollama pull deepseek-r1
   ollama list | grep deepseek
   ```

2. **Slow Response Times**

   ```python
   # Optimize model parameters
   model = OllamaLLM(
       model="deepseek-r1",
       temperature=0.1,  # Lower for more focused reasoning
       timeout=120,      # Longer timeout for complex reasoning
   )
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**

   ```bash
   # Monitor system resources
   ollama ps

   # Adjust Ollama memory settings
   export OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1
   ```

4. **Reasoning Quality Issues**

   ```python
   # Use more specific prompts
   prompt = f"""Think through this problem step by step:

   {question}

   Please show your complete reasoning process."""
   ```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Reasoning Chain Visualization

```python
def visualize_reasoning_chain(response: str):
    """Extract and visualize reasoning steps"""
    steps = extract_reasoning_steps(response)

    for i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):
        print(f"Step {i}: {step}")
        print("↓")

    print("Final Answer")

def extract_reasoning_steps(response: str) -> List[str]:
    """Extract individual reasoning steps from response"""
    # Implementation to parse reasoning steps
    pass
```

    def continue_reasoning(self, follow_up: str) -> str:
        """Continue reasoning from previous context"""
        context = "\n".join(self.conversation_history)
        prompt = f"""
        Previous reasoning:
        {context}

        Follow-up question: {follow_up}

        Please continue the reasoning from where we left off:
        """

        response = self.model.invoke(prompt)
        self.conversation_history.append(f"Follow-up: {follow_up}")
        self.conversation_history.append(f"Response: {response}")
