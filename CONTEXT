## for all notebooks in the Langgraph_agents directory, add suitable markdown blocks and comments. You must start with h2 headings, and structure it like a tutorial, explaining each step in detail. Make sure every markdown adds value, if not, don't add a markdown there. Your notes must be concise and to-the-point, only stating what's needed to understand the flow and why it's structued that way, WITHOUT ANY FLUFF. Still, remember to explain the REASON AND CONCEPTS behind each. Explain each step and its basic concepts, eg: what a tool is and why we use it.
